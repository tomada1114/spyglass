## Dependency Policy

- The template ships with ZERO package dependencies — keep it that way unless the app truly needs one
- Before adding a dependency: verify active maintenance, compatible license (MIT/BSD/Apache),
  and minimal transitive dependencies
- `Package.resolved` MUST be committed alongside any dependency change
- NEVER lower the coverage floor (currently 80% on SpyglassCore)
- NEVER remove SwiftLint rules without explicit user approval

## Project Generation

- `project.yml` is the source of truth; `Spyglass.xcodeproj` is generated and gitignored —
  never hand-edit or commit it
- After changing `project.yml`, run `just generate` and build to verify

## Toolchain Pinning

- `.xcode-version` is the single source of truth for the CI Xcode pin (every macOS job
  derives `DEVELOPER_DIR` from it); CLI tools are pinned in `mise.toml`
- Bump pins deliberately (roughly monthly), one commit per bump, after `just check` passes locally
- Dependabot's `cooldown.default-days: 7` delays update PRs for SwiftPM and Actions; note that
  SwiftPM itself has no resolver-level cooldown (unlike uv's `exclude-newer`), so fresh installs
  are only protected by the committed `Package.resolved`
