# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- [Xcode 26.5+](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (`xcode-select --install` alone is not enough — the app target needs the full IDE toolchain; CI pins the exact version in `.xcode-version`)
- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) — installs the pinned CLI tools from `mise.toml`
- [Just](https://just.systems/man/en/installation.html) (optional — every recipe's underlying commands are plain shell; see CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Setup

```bash
mise trust     # approve this repo's mise.toml (asked once per clone)
just install
```

mise refuses to read config files it has not been told to trust, so a fresh
clone needs `mise trust` first (interactively it prompts; non-interactive
runs fail without it). `just install` then runs `mise install` (SwiftLint,
SwiftFormat, XcodeGen, xcbeautify, actionlint, ShellCheck — all pinned), points
`core.hooksPath` at `.githooks/` for the fast pre-commit lint, and generates
`Spyglass.xcodeproj`.

## Everyday Commands

```bash
just check     # the full local gate: fmt → lint → test → build
just test      # Swift Testing suite + 80% coverage floor on SpyglassCore
just uitest    # XCUITest launch test (first local run may prompt for Accessibility)
just smoke     # Release build + "does it actually launch" assertion
```

## Open in Xcode

```bash
just generate
open Spyglass.xcodeproj
```

Remember: `Spyglass.xcodeproj` is generated from `project.yml` and gitignored.
Change targets/settings in `project.yml`, then `just generate`.

## App Icon

The template ships `App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` with empty slots —
the app builds and runs without icon artwork. To add yours, open the project in
Xcode and drop PNG sizes onto the AppIcon set (App target → Assets), or edit
`AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json` directly, then rebuild. `project.yml` already
wires the catalog via `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME: AppIcon`.
